The project involves creating a website that showcases different functionalities. The first part of the project involves creating a template in an HTML file and then reusing it in multiple tasks. The next part involves adding a family tree table to the template and allowing the user to add new members to the table by submitting a form. The following part involves importing jQuery and using its ajax methods to query data from Wikipedia API and displaying it on the page in the form of a search result list. The last part involves adding pagination to the search results, where the user can navigate through different pages of the results by clicking on the page numbers. Throughout the project, there is a focus on creating and reusing functions, using different CSS styles, and using JavaScript to manipulate the HTML elements on the page.
